# Iterative-prisoner-dilemma-with-mutations
The Prisoner's Dilemma (PD) is a classical game analyzed in game theory, which is widely used to (attempt to) model social/economic interaction.
In this project, we have analyzed and simulated different strategies.
In the final part, we sought alternative strategies with mutation algorithms.
